# What does this do?
This mod aims to produce a semi-accurate model of chemistry in Minetest through maintaining a full complement of craftitems representing the elements, and in a slight deviation from real chemistry, the ability to "shave down" an atom to create the last nobel gas. The resulting subatomic particles can be "crafted" on to another atom (another deviation) to create another element. So in short, this is a slightly cheaty way to convert one material to another, a thinly disguised form of **science** in Minetest.
